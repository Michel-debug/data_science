# X-Datascience Datacamp

*Datacamp class for master student - 5 days*

The aim of this course is to learn data science by doing. All aspects of completing a data science pipeline will be covered, from exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, parameter optimization to advanced learning algorithms. You will also need to setup your own challenge!

Grade is a mix of your performance on the data challenge offered to the class as well as the challenge you will setup.

Each day you will have 50% of lectures and 50% of work on the competitive challenge using the [RAMP](https://ramp.studio/) website.

The slides used in some of the lectures are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JvosHOvskofoBgf3CKLaQ72F_UET9aVX?usp=sharing).

### Location

The course will be during the week from Dec 18 to Dec 22 in person.

On GitHub you have some of the teaching materials at: https://github.com/x-datascience-datacamp

You **must** have a GitHub account to complete the course.

### Setup:

We will be using many Python packages in this course such as `pandas`, 
`sklearn`, and `matplotlib`, and they can all be downloaded and installed using
a package-management system. We recommend you to use [`mamba`](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/)
but you will be fine if you already have [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) 
installed in your computer.

**NB**: Windows users should be sure to closely follow the instructions for 
installing `mamba` and `conda`, since many common problems come from not having 
properly setup the `PATH` variable for the system.
